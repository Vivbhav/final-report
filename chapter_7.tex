During the literature summary an exhaustive survey of the research already
conducted in Automatic Question Generation Systems was conducted. Following are
a few of the research papers, we referred - 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Deep Guessing: Generating Meaningful Personalized Quizzes on Historical
Topics by Introducing Wikicategories in Doc2Vec \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8501891/}

\item Automatic Question Generation for Intelligent Tutoring Systems \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8066538/}

\item Context Aware Restricted Tourism Domain Question Answering System \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7877473/}

\item Automatic Question Generation System \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6996216/}

\item Automatic Question Generation from Childrenâ€™s Stories for Companion
Chatbot \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424749/}

\item Computational Intelligence Framework for Automatic Quiz Question
Generation \url(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8491624}
\end{enumerate}

Among other things, we would also like to add a few of the online resources we
used to learn concepts of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing, which
were of foremost importance in the design and implementation of the model we
have proposed.
