\chapter{Problem Statement} 

The problem of question generation, is currently solved by domain experts, who
create questions over text or topics by their intuition or knowledge. Automatic
Question Generation can solve this laborious, time consuming task quite
efficiently and much higher accuracy. Such an automatic question generation
system can have applications in multiple domains. 

\section{Motivation} 

The main motivation of designing an Automatic Question Generation System, was
contribution in the education domain. Generating quiz questions can be of utmost
importance for teachers to ensure that students are able to understand the
material in class, and at the same time, can become an easy way out for students
to find out their preparedness over the subject, studying independently. 

\section{Objectives}

The objective of the project is to take a topic as input from the user, and
generate a set of questions related to the topic to present to the user. The
questions generated through such a system, should be similar to questions
generated by a domain expert. Also the difficulty level of the questions, should
be such that they can appropriately test the knowledge of the user.
