\chapter{Problem Statement} 

The problem of question generation, is currently solved by domain experts, who
create questions over text or topics by their intuition or knowledge. Automatic
Question Generation can solve this laborious, time consuming task quite
efficiently and with much higher accuracy. Such an automatic question generation
system can have applications in multiple domains. 

\section{Motivation} 

The main motivation of designing an Automatic Question Generation System, was to
contribute in the education domain. Quiz questions can be of utmost
importance for teachers to ensure that students are able to understand the
material taught in class. Similarly quizzes can be used by students
to find out their preparedness of the subject at hand.

\section{Objectives}

The objective of the project is to devise a system to generate a set of questions based on a topic provided by the user. The
questions generated by this system, should be similar to questions
generated by a domain expert. The difficulty level of the questions generated, should
be such that they appropriately test the knowledge of the user.
